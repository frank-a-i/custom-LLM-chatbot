      "---\n",
      "Tempo may be adjusted using the SNAPSHOT encoder or by selecting \"Tempo\" from the menu.\n",
      "---\n",
      "ZynSeq allows tempo to be adjusted from 1.0 BPM to 420.0 BPM in 0.1 BPM steps. Tempo may also be altered by external modules, e.g. MIDI player.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Knob K3 is used to adjust the tempo. When rotated, the Zynthian tempo screen will be shown briefly. This tempo setting is synchronized with the MPK. \n",
      "---\n",
      "For instance, if you are in the mixer view and short-push OPT/ADMIN, the Main menu will be opened. If you short-push it again, the Admin menu will be opened. Then, if you bold-push the MIX/LEVEL button, the Audio Levels view will be opened. You push \"metronome\" button and the Tempo settings view will be opened. If you tap-it several times, the tempo BPM will be changed, e.g. tap twice per second to set tempo to 120BPM.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Each sequence has a timebase track which may have tempo and time signature (beats per bar) events. These will influence all playback. The ability to manipulate sequence timebase events is not yet implemented.\n",
      "---\n",
      "View buttons are outlined on green in the image and they allow direct access to the main views. Most of these buttons have 2 different views assigned, with a horizontal line separating two printed labels. The primary view is printed at top and the secondary view is printed at bottom. The \"metronome\" button is the exception, as it's the tap-tempo button. You push it once to access the tempo settings view, but you can tap-it several times to change the tempo BPM. Try it!\n",
      "---\n",
      "Sequences may be configured to stay synchronised with shorter phrases pausing and starting again at start of bar or polymeters may be implemented with shorter patterns driftting across longer ones.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Zynthian allows the beats per bar to be configured but not the beat type. All beats are assumed to be quarter notes and the default beats per bar is 4, hence a 4/4 time signature. The beats per bar may be adjusted from a menu option and can be set to any value between 1 and 64. The most significant behaviour that beats per bar influences is the sync point. The sync point is the point at which a sequence starts, loops or stops and is synonymous with start of bar hence the beats per bar defines the quantity of beats between sync points which in turn defines the rate at which sequences will loop.\n",

      "NOTE: The MPK resolution is 1BPM, but Zynthian is 0.1BPM; take this into account to avoid drifting. \n",
      "---\n",
      "There are vertical white lines indicating the beats. The quantity of beats in the pattern may be adjusted from the menu as well as the quantity of steps in each beat. This allows the duration and quantisation level of the pattern to be adjusted. Changing the beats in pattern will change the pattern duration. Changing the steps per beat will change the pattern resolution.\n",
      "---\n",
      "ZynSeq uses JACK timebase for its timing. Transport control and adjustment of tempo may be made by external JACK clients. Those clients may also use the same timebase. This means that ZynSeq can synchronise with other modules within Zynthian, e.g. synth engine LFO, arpeggiators, etc. It also means that other modules may control ZynSeq playback to some degree. ZynSeq acts as the timebase master, i.e. the concept of bars, beats and ticks (fractions of beats) and consequently tempo (BPM) is provided by ZynSeq. There is currently no mechanism to lock to external MIDI clock but a Zynthian MIDI effects layer may be used to create MIDI clock output. There is a plan to improve this support in a future update.\n",
      "---\n",
      "You may wish to use one sequence as a click track by having a simple percusion sound looping. You could use a similar track in oneshot mode as the count-in for a song, pressing pads for the first bars of the song whilst the count-in playing or maybe use a silent sequence for the same purpose to allow manual synchronisation of several sequences at the start of a performance.\n",
      "---\n",

      "To preview a pattern, start or pause the transport by pressing the play button, learn/shot encoder or tapping the status area. A coloured bar at the bottom of the view will move left to right to indicate the position of the playhead and any notes entered in the pattern will be sent to the zynthian's engines. To stop and recue to the start of the pattern, bold press. Playback speed (Tempo) can be adjusted with the encoder 1 or by selecting \"Tempo\" from the menu.\n",

      "The playback indication icon changes to red to indicate it is stopping and then disappears to indicate it has stopped. Most play modes will continue to play the sequence until the next sync point. A sync point may be thought of as the start or end of a bar, indeed their spacing is set using the menu option Beats per bar.\n",
      "---\n",
      "A pattern may be exported as a standard MIDI file. The tempo and all the notes within the pattern on its current channel will be exported to a file in Zynthian's capture location which may be accessed via webconf. The filename will consist of the pattern number and a date / time stamp of when the export occured, e.g. pattern2_2021-02-18 15:15:19.335558.mid.\n",
